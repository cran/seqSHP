Description: Based on the structure of the SPSS version of the Swiss
    Household Panel (SHP) data, provides a function seqFromWaves()
    that seeks the data of variables specified by the user in each 
    of the wave files and collects them as sequences. The function also 
    matches the sequences with variables from other files such as the 
    master files of persons (MP) and households (MH), and social origins (SO). 
    It can also match with activity calendar data (CA).
